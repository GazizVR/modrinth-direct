## What is this?

Modrinth Direct is a client-side Fabric mod that replaces the vanilla **Mods** button
(added by ModMenu) with a fully functional mod browser powered by the
[Modrinth API](https://docs.modrinth.com). Search, browse, and install mods into your
`mods/` folder — all without switching to a browser or launcher.

## Features

- 🔍 **In-game mod search** — query the entire Modrinth library without leaving the game
- 📦 **One-click install** — download and save the `.jar` directly to your `mods/` folder
- 🔗 **Automatic dependency resolution** — required dependencies are fetched and installed automatically
- 🗂️ **Installed mods tab** — keeps track of everything you've installed through the mod
- 🖼️ **Mod icons** — loads mod artwork inline, including WebP format
- 🍞 **Toast notifications** — in-game feedback for download progress, success, and errors
- ♻️ **Non-destructive** — a simple restart is all it takes for new mods to activate
